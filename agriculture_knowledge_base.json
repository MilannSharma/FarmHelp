Broader definitions also include forestry and aquaculture . Agriculture was a key factor in the rise of sedentary human civilization , whereby farming of domesticated plants and animals created food surpluses that enabled people to live in the cities. While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the 20th century, industrial agriculture based on large-scale monocultures came to dominate agricultural output. As of 2021 update , small farms , of which the vast majority are one hectare about 2.5 acres or smaller, produce about one-third of the worlds food. Moreover, five of every six farms in the world consist of fewer than 2 hectares 4.9 acres and take up only around 12 of all agricultural land.  1  In terms of total land use, large farms are dominant.  1  While only 1 of all farms globally are greater than 50 hectares 120 acres, they encompass more than 70 of the worlds farmland.  1  Further, nearly 40 of all global agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hectares 2,500 acres.  1  Farms and farming greatly influence rural economics and greatly shape rural society , affecting both the direct agricultural workforce and broader businesses that support the farms and farming populations. The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods , fibers , fuels , and raw materials such as rubber . Food classes include cereals  grains , vegetables , fruits , cooking oils , meat , milk , eggs , and fungi . Global agricultural production amounts to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food,  2  32 million tonnes of natural fibers  3  and 4 billion m 3 of wood.  4  However, around 14 of the worlds food is lost from production before reaching the retail level.  5  Modern agronomy , plant breeding , agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers , and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields , but also contributed to ecological and environmental damage . Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to climate change , depletion of aquifers , deforestation , antibiotic resistance , and other agricultural pollution . Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation , such as biodiversity loss , desertification , soil degradation , and climate change , all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some countries ban them . Etymology and scope Further information Horticulture  Scope The word agriculture is a late Middle English adaptation of Latin agricultūra , from ager field and cultūra  cultivation  or growing.  6  While agriculture usually refers to human activities, certain species of ant ,  7   8  termite and beetle have been cultivating crops for up to 60 million years.  9  Agriculture is defined with varying scopes, in its broadest sense using natural resources to produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services.  10  Thus defined, it includes arable farming , horticulture, animal husbandry and forestry , but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded.  10  It may also be broadly decomposed into plant agriculture , which concerns the cultivation of useful plants,  11  and animal agriculture , the production of agricultural animals.  12  History Centres of origin , as numbered by Nikolai Vavilov in the 1930s. Area 3 is no longer recognized as a center of origin New Guinea area P was identified more recently.  13   14  Main article History of agriculture Origins Main article Neolithic Revolution The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering .  15  Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe,  16  and included a diverse range of taxa , in at least 11 separate centers of origin .  13  Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago.  17  In the Paleolithic Levant, 23,000 years ago, cereals cultivation of emmer , barley , and oats has been observed near the sea of Galilee .  18   19  Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC,  20  followed by mung , soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago.  21  Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago.  22  Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia,  23  where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago.  24  In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca , llamas , alpacas , and guinea pigs . Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago,  25  and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. In Mesoamerica , wild teosinte was bred into maize corn from 10,000 to 6,000 years ago.  26   27   28  The horse was domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes around 3500 BC.  29  Scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism  examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant , and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.  30   31   32  Civilizations Map of the world showing approximate centers of origin of agriculture and its spread in prehistory.  33  DNA studies have shown that agriculture was introduced in Europe by the expansion of the early farmers from Anatolia about 9,000 years ago.  34  In Eurasia, the Sumerians started to live in villages from about 8,000 BC, relying on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and a canal system for irrigation. Ploughs appear in pictographs around 3,000 BC seed-ploughs around 2,300 BC. Farmers grew wheat, barley, vegetables such as lentils and onions, and fruits including dates, grapes, and figs.  35  Ancient Egyptian agriculture relied on the Nile River and its seasonal flooding. Farming started in the predynastic period at the end of the Paleolithic , after 10,000 BC. Staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley, alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus .  36   37  In India , wheat, barley and jujube were domesticated by 9,000 BC, soon followed by sheep and goats.  38  Cattle, sheep and goats were domesticated in Mehrgarh culture by 8,0006,000 BC.  39   40   41  Cotton was cultivated by the 5th4th millennium BC.  42  Archeological evidence indicates an animal-drawn plough from 2,500 BC in the Indus Valley civilization .  43  In China, from the 5th century BC, there was a nationwide granary system and widespread silk farming .  44  Water-powered grain mills were in use by the 1st century BC,  45  followed by irrigation.  46  By the late 2nd century, heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards .  47   48  These spread westwards across Eurasia.  49  Asian rice was domesticated 8,20013,500 years ago  depending on the molecular clock estimate that is used  50   on the Pearl River in southern China with a single genetic origin from the wild rice Oryza rufipogon .  51  In Greece and Rome , the major cereals were wheat, emmer, and barley, alongside vegetables including peas, beans, and olives. Sheep and goats were kept mainly for dairy products.  52   53  Agricultural scenes of threshing , a grain store, harvesting with sickles , digging, tree-cutting and ploughing from ancient Egypt . Tomb of Nakht , 15th century BC In the Americas, crops domesticated in Mesoamerica apart from teosinte include squash, beans, and cacao .  54  Cocoa was domesticated by the Mayo Chinchipe of the upper Amazon around 3,000 BC.  55  The turkey was probably domesticated in Mexico or the American Southwest.  56  The Aztecs developed irrigation systems, formed terraced hillsides, fertilized their soil, and developed chinampas or artificial islands. The Mayas used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland from 400 BC.  57   58   59   60   61  In South America agriculture may have begun about 9000 BC with the domestication of squash Cucurbita and other plants.  62  Coca was domesticated in the Andes, as were the peanut, tomato, tobacco, and pineapple .  54  Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC.  63  Animals including llamas , alpacas , and guinea pigs were domesticated there.  64  In North America , the indigenous people of the East domesticated crops such as sunflower , tobacco,  65  squash and Chenopodium .  66   67  Wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested.  68  The domesticated strawberry is a hybrid of a Chilean and a North American species, developed by breeding in Europe and North America.  69  The indigenous people of the Southwest and the Pacific Northwest practiced forest gardening and fire-stick farming . The natives controlled fire on a regional scale to create a low-intensity fire ecology that sustained a low-density agriculture in loose rotation a sort of wild permaculture .  70   71   72   73  A system of companion planting called the Three Sisters was developed in North America. The three crops were winter squash , maize, and climbing beans.  74   75  Indigenous Australians , long supposed to have been nomadic hunter-gatherers , practiced systematic burning, possibly to enhance natural productivity in fire-stick farming.  76  Scholars have pointed out that hunter-gatherers need a productive environment to support gathering without cultivation. Because the forests of New Guinea have few food plants, early humans may have used selective burning to increase the productivity of the wild karuka fruit trees to support the hunter-gatherer way of life.  77  The Gunditjmara and other groups developed eel farming and fish trapping systems from some 5,000 years ago.  78  There is evidence of intensification across the whole continent over that period.  79  In two regions of Australia, the central west coast and eastern central, early farmers cultivated yams, native millet, and bush onions, possibly in permanent settlements.  32   80  Revolution Agricultural calendar, c. 1470 , from a manuscript of Pietro de Crescenzi In the Middle Ages , compared to the Roman period , agriculture in Western Europe became more focused on self-sufficiency . The agricultural population under feudalism was typically organized into manors consisting of several hundred or more acres of land presided over by a lord of the manor with a Roman Catholic church and priest.  81  Thanks to the exchange with the Al-Andalus where the Arab Agricultural Revolution was underway, European agriculture transformed, with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange.  82  After 1492, the Columbian exchange brought New World crops such as maize, potatoes, tomatoes, sweet potatoes , and manioc to Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice, and turnips , and livestock including horses, cattle, sheep and goats to the Americas.  83  Irrigation , crop rotation , and fertilizers advanced from the 17th century with the British Agricultural Revolution , allowing global population to rise significantly. Since 1900, agriculture in developed nations, and to a lesser extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as mechanization replaces human labor, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers , pesticides, and selective breeding . The Haber-Bosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields and sustaining a further increase in global population.  84   85  Modern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological, political, and economic issues including water pollution , biofuels , genetically modified organisms , tariffs and farm subsidies , leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement .  86   87  Unsustainable farming practices in North America led to the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.  88  Types Reindeer herds form the basis of pastoral agriculture for several Arctic and Subarctic peoples. Harvesting wheat with a combine harvester accompanied by a tractor and trailer Pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals. In nomadic pastoralism , herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practiced in arid and semi-arid regions of Sahara , Central Asia and some parts of India.  89  Spreading manure by hand in Zambia In shifting cultivation , a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the trees. The cleared land is used for growing crops for a few years until the soil becomes too infertile, and the area is abandoned. Another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated. This type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is used in Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.  90  Subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone, with little left over for transport elsewhere. It is intensively practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia.  91  An estimated 2.5 billion subsistence farmers worked in 2018, cultivating about 60 of the earths arable land .  92  Intensive farming is cultivation to maximize productivity, with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs water, fertilizer, pesticide and automation. It is practiced mainly in developed countries.  93   94  Contemporary agriculture Status Suitability for agriculture of land around the world US Department of Agriculture, 1998 Recent trends of employment in agriculture including forestry and fishing by region From the twentieth century onwards, intensive agriculture increased crop productivity. It substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, but caused increased water pollution, and often involved farm subsidies. Soil degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns globally  95  approximately 40 of the worlds agricultural land is seriously degraded.  96   97  In recent years there has been a backlash against the environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic , regenerative , and sustainable agriculture movements.  86   98  One of the major forces behind this movement has been the European Union , which first certified organic food in 1991 and began reform of its Common Agricultural Policy CAP in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies,  99  also known as decoupling . The growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management , selective breeding,  100  and controlled-environment agriculture .  101   102  There are concerns about the lower yield associated with organic farming and its impact on global food security .  103  Recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food .  104  Development of agricultural output of China in 2015 US since 1961 By 2015, the agricultural output of China was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States.  105  Economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture, according to which agriculture in the United States is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948.  106  Agriculture employed 873 million people in 2021, or 27 of the global workforce, compared with 1 027 million or 40 in 2000. The share of agriculture in global GDP was stable at around 4 since 20002023.  107  Despite increases in agricultural production and productivity,  108  between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021.  109  Food insecurity and malnutrition can be the result of conflict, climate extremes and variability and economic swings.  108  It can also be caused by a countrys structural characteristics such as income status and natural resource endowments as well as its political economy.  108  Pesticide use in agriculture went up 62 between 2000 and 2021, with the Americas accounting for half the use in 2021.  107  The International Fund for Agricultural Development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security , given the favorable experience of Vietnam.  110  Workforce See also Gender roles in agriculture Worldwide employment In agriculture, forestry and fishing in 2021 Agriculture provides about one-quarter of all global employment, more than half in sub-Saharan Africa and almost 60 percent in low-income countries.  111  As countries develop, other jobs have historically pulled workers away from agriculture, and labor-saving innovations increase agricultural productivity by reducing labor requirements per unit of output.  112   113   114  Over time, a combination of labor supply and labor demand trends have driven down the share of population employed in agriculture.  115   116  On the three-sector theory , the proportion of people working in agriculture left-hard bar in each group, green falls as an economy becomes more developed. During the 16th century in Europe, between 55 and 75 of the population was engaged in agriculture by the 19th century, this had dropped to between 35 and 65.  117  In the same countries today, the figure is less than 10.  118  At the start of the 21st century, some one billion people, or over 13 of the available work force, were employed in agriculture. This constitutes approximately 70 of the global employment of children, and in many countries constitutes the largest percentage of women of any industry.  119  The service sector overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007.  120  In many developed countries, immigrants help fill labor shortages in high-value agriculture activities that are difficult to mechanize.  121  Foreign farm workers from mostly Eastern Europe, North Africa and South Asia constituted around one-third of the salaried agricultural workforce in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal in 2013.  122   123   124   125  In the United States of America, more than half of all hired farmworkers roughly 450,000 workers were immigrants in 2019, although the number of new immigrants arriving in the country to work in agriculture has fallen by 75 percent in recent years and rising wages indicate this has led to a major labor shortage on U.S. farms.  126   127  Women in agriculture Around the world, women make up a large share of the population employed in agriculture.  128  This share is growing in all developing regions except East and Southeast Asia where women already make up about 50 percent of the agricultural workforce.  128  Women make up 47 percent of the agricultural workforce in sub-Saharan Africa, a rate that has not changed significantly in the past few decades.  128  However, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO posits that the roles and responsibilities of women in agriculture may be changing  for example, from subsistence farming to wage employment, and from contributing household members to primary producers in the context of male-out-migration.  128  In general, women account for a greater share of agricultural employment at lower levels of economic development, as inadequate education, limited access to basic infrastructure and markets, high unpaid work burden and poor rural employment opportunities outside agriculture severely limit womens opportunities for off-farm work.  129  Women who work in agricultural production tend to do so under highly unfavorable conditions. They tend to be concentrated in the poorest countries, where alternative livelihoods are not available, and they maintain the intensity of their work in conditions of climate-induced weather shocks and in situations of conflict. Women are less likely to participate as entrepreneurs and independent farmers and are engaged in the production of less lucrative crops.  129  The gender gap in land productivity between female- and male managed farms of the same size is 24 percent. On average, women earn 18.4 percent less than men in wage employment in agriculture this means that women receive 82 cents for every dollar earned by men. Progress has been slow in closing gaps in womens access to irrigation and in ownership of livestock, too.  129  Women in agriculture still have significantly less access than men to inputs, including improved seeds, fertilizers and mechanized equipment. On a positive note, the gender gap in access to mobile internet in low- and middle-income countries fell from 25 percent to 16 percent between 2017 and 2021, and the gender gap in access to bank accounts narrowed from 9 to 6 percentage points. Women are as likely as men to adopt new technologies when the necessary enabling factors are put in place and they have equal access to complementary resources.  129  Safety Main article Agricultural safety and health Rollover protection bar retrofitted to a mid-20th century Fordson tractor Agriculture, specifically farming, remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss , skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. On industrialized farms , injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery , and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers .  130  Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can be hazardous to worker health , and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects.  131  As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death.  132  Ages 06 may be an especially vulnerable population in agriculture  133  common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor accidents, including with all-terrain vehicles.  132   133   134  The International Labor Organization considers agriculture one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors.  119  It estimates that the annual work-related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170,000, twice the average rate of other jobs. In addition, incidences of death, injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported.  135  The organization has developed the Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001 , which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation, the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play.  119  In the United States, agriculture has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda to identify and provide intervention strategies for occupational health and safety issues.  136   137  In the European Union, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work has issued guidelines on implementing health and safety directives in agriculture, livestock farming, horticulture, and forestry.  138  The Agricultural Safety and Health Council of America ASHCA also holds a yearly summit to discuss safety.  139  Production Main article List of countries by GDP sector composition See also List of most important agricultural crops worldwide Value of agricultural production, 2016  140  Overall production varies by country as listed.

This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients fertilizer or manure  and some manual pest control . Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.  143  Intercropping of coconut and Mexican marigold Further industrialization led to the use of monocultures , when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low biodiversity , nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers.  142  Multiple cropping , in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and intercropping , when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures .  143  In subtropical and arid environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring irrigation. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown coffee, chocolate and systems are practiced such as agroforestry . In temperate environments, where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie , highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.  143  Important categories of food crops include cereals, legumes, forage, fruits and vegetables.  144  Natural fibers include cotton, wool , hemp , silk and flax .  145  Specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world. Production is listed in millions of metric tons, based on FAO estimates.  144  Top agricultural products, by crop types million tonnes 2004 data Cereals 2,263 Vegetables and melons 866 Roots and tubers 715 Milk 619 Fruit 503 Meat 259 Oilcrops 133 Fish 2001 estimate 130 Eggs 63 Pulses 60 Vegetable fiber 30 Source Food and Agriculture Organization  144  Top agricultural products, by individual crops million tonnes 2011 data Sugar cane 1794 Maize 883 Rice 722 Wheat 704 Potatoes 374 Sugar beet 271 Soybeans 260 Cassava 252 Tomatoes 159 Barley 134 Source Food and Agriculture Organization  144  Livestock production systems Main articles Livestock and Animal husbandry See also List of domesticated animals Intensively farmed pigs Animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat, milk, eggs , or wool , and for work and transport.  146  Working animals , including horses, mules , oxen , water buffalo , camels, llamas, alpacas, donkeys, and dogs, have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields, harvest crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers.  147  Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless.  148  As of 2010 update , 30 of Earths ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock, with the sector employing approximately 1.3 billion people. Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.  149  Aquaculture or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9 a year between 1975 and 2007.  150  During the second half of the 20th century, producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity . This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.  151  Raising chickens intensively for meat in a broiler house Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland , rangeland , and pastures for feeding ruminant animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 3040 million pastoralists.  143  Mixed production systems use grassland, fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric one stomach mainly chickens and pigs livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.  148  Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure use becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.  148  Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75 of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in confined animal feeding operations , sometimes called factory farming . Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.  149  Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of growth hormones , are controversial.  152  Production practices Tilling an arable field Further information Tillage , Crop rotation , and Irrigation Tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or harrow to prepare for planting, for nutrient incorporation, or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no-till . It can improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO 2 , and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.  153   154  Pest control includes the management of weeds, insects, mites , and diseases. Chemical pesticides, biological  biocontrol , mechanical tillage, and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include crop rotation, culling , cover crops , intercropping, composting , avoidance, and resistance. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.  155  Nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of use of manure produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, green manure , compost and minerals.  156  Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period. Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures .  153   157  Water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.  143  Some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the Great Plains in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture for the following year.  158  Recent technological innovations in precision agriculture allow for water status monitoring and automate water usage, leading to more efficient management.  159  Agriculture represents 70 of freshwater use worldwide.  160  However, water withdrawal ratios for agriculture vary significantly by income level. In least developed countries and landlocked developing countries, water withdrawal ratios for agriculture are as high as 90 percent of total water withdrawals and about 60 percent in Small Island Developing States .  161  According to 2014 report by the International Food Policy Research Institute , agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other. Using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the International Food Policy Research Institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40 and food prices could be reduced by almost half.  162  Payment for ecosystem services is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment. Measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city, to improve the supply of fresh water.  163  Agricultural automation Different definitions exist for agricultural automation and for the variety of tools and technologies that are used to automate production. One view is that agricultural automation refers to autonomous navigation by robots without human intervention.  164  Alternatively, it is defined as the accomplishment of production tasks through mobile, autonomous, decision-making, mechatronic devices.  165  However, FAO finds that these definitions do not capture all the aspects and forms of automation, such as robotic milking machines that are static, most motorized machinery that automates the performing of agricultural operations, and digital tools e.g., sensors that automate only diagnosis.  159  FAO defines agricultural automation as the use of machinery and equipment in agricultural operations to improve their diagnosis, decision-making or performing, reducing the drudgery of agricultural work or improving the timeliness, and potentially the precision, of agricultural operations.  166  The technological evolution in agriculture has involved a progressive move from manual tools to animal traction, to motorized mechanization, to digital equipment and finally, to robotics with artificial intelligence AI.  166  Motorized mechanization using engine power automates the performance of agricultural operations such as ploughing and milking.  167  With digital automation technologies, it also becomes possible to automate diagnosis and decision-making of agricultural operations.  166  For example, autonomous crop robots can harvest and seed crops, while drones can gather information to help automate input application.  159  Precision agriculture often employs such automation technologies.  159  Motorized machines are increasingly complemented, or even superseded, by new digital equipment that automates diagnosis and decision-making.  167  A conventional tractor, for example, can be converted into an automated vehicle allowing it to sow a field autonomously.  167  Motorized mechanization has increased significantly across the world in recent years, although reliable global data with broad country coverage exist only for tractors and only up to 2009.  168  Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where the adoption of motorized mechanization has stalled over the past decades.  159   169  Automation technologies are increasingly used for managing livestock, though evidence on adoption is lacking. Global automatic milking system sales have increased over recent years, but adoption is likely mostly in Northern Europe,  170  and likely almost absent in low- and middle-income countries. Automated feeding machines for both cows and poultry also exist, but data and evidence regarding their adoption trends and drivers is likewise scarce.  171   159  Measuring the overall employment impacts of agricultural automation is difficult because it requires large amounts of data tracking all the transformations and the associated reallocation of workers both upstream and downstream.  166  While automation technologies reduce labor needs for the newly automated tasks, they also generate new labor demand for other tasks, such as equipment maintenance and operation.  159  Agricultural automation can also stimulate employment by allowing producers to expand production and by creating other agrifood systems jobs.  172  This is especially true when it happens in context of rising scarcity of rural labor, as is the case in high-income countries and many middle-income countries.  172  On the other hand, if forcedly promoted, for example through government subsidies in contexts of abundant rural labor, it can lead to labor displacement and falling or stagnant wages, particularly affecting poor and low-skilled workers.  172  Effects of climate change on yields Main article Effects of climate change on agriculture The sixth IPCC Assessment Report projects changes in average soil moisture at 2.0 C of warming, as measured in standard deviations from the 1850 to 1900 baseline. Climate change and agriculture are interrelated on a global scale. Climate change affects agriculture through changes in average temperatures , rainfall, and weather extremes like storms and heat waves changes in pests and diseases changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground-level ozone concentrations changes in the nutritional quality of some foods  173  and changes in sea level .  174  Global warming is already affecting agriculture, with effects unevenly distributed across the world.  175  In a 2022 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change describes how human-induced warming has slowed growth of agricultural productivity over the past 50 years in mid and low latitudes.  176  Methane emissions have negatively impacted crop yields by increasing temperatures and surface ozone concentrations.  176  Warming is also negatively affecting crop and grassland quality and harvest stability.  176  Ocean warming has decreased sustainable yields of some wild fish populations while ocean acidification and warming have already affected farmed aquatic species.  176  Climate change will probably increase the risk of food insecurity for some vulnerable groups, such as the poor .  177  Crop alteration and biotechnology Plant breeding Main article Plant breeding Wheat cultivar tolerant of high salinity left compared with non-tolerant variety Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist Gregor Mendel . His work on dominant and recessive alleles , although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, self-pollination and cross-pollination , and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.  178  Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and drought tolerance , eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture grasses and clover in New Zealand. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts i.e. primitive genetic engineering during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn maize and barley.  179   180  Seedlings in a green house. This is what it looks like when seedlings are growing from plant breeding. The Green Revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating high-yielding varieties. For example, average yields of corn maize in the US have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare tha 40 bushels per acre in 1900 to about 9.4 tha 150 bushels per acre in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 tha in 1900 to more than 2.5 tha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 tha, African under 1 tha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 tha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 tha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, and growth control to avoid lodging.  181   182   183  Increase of intellectual property protection for agri inventions, as seen in the total number of patents , utility models and plant varieties equivalent protection systems applied for on agricultural innovation worldwide. Investments into innovation for agriculture are long term. This is because it takes time for research to become commercialized and for technology to be adapted to meet multiple regions needs, as well as meet national guidelines before being adopted and planted in a farmers fields. For instance, it took at least 60 years from the introduction of hybrid corn technology before its adoption became widespread.  184   185  Agricultural innovation developed for the specific agroecological conditions of one region is not easily transferred and used in another region with different agroecological conditions. Instead, the innovation would have to be adapted to the specific conditions of that other region and respect its biodiversity and environmental requirements and guidelines. Some such adaptations can be seen through the steadily increasing number of plant varieties protected under the plant variety protection instrument administered by the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants UPOV.  184  Genetic engineering Main article Genetic engineering See also Genetically modified food , Genetically modified crops , Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms , and Genetically modified food controversies Genetically modified potato plants left resist virus diseases that damage unmodified plants right. Genetically modified organisms GMO are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology . Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to use in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering.  186  For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops.  187  The Biosafety Protocol , an international treaty, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.  188  Herbicide-resistant seeds have a gene implanted into their genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate . These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.  189  With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides.  190   191  Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.  192  Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis Bt, which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects.  193  Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.  194  Environmental impact Main article Environmental issues with agriculture Effects and costs Water pollution in a rural stream due to runoff from farming activity in New Zealand Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation , such as biodiversity loss , desertification , soil degradation and climate change , which cause decreases in crop yield.  195  Agriculture is one of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. Agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment, including insecticides , especially those used on cotton.  196   197  The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report stated that agricultural operations produced some 13 percent of anthropogenic global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes gases from the use of inorganic fertilizers, agro-chemical pesticides, and herbicides, as well as fossil fuel-energy inputs.  198  Agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature especially herbicides and insecticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, and loss of natural environment. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of 2,343 million, or 208 per hectare.  199  A 2005 analysis of these costs in the US concluded that cropland imposes approximately 5 to 16 billion 30 to 96 per hectare, while livestock production imposes 714 million.  200  Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.  199   200  Agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs, often employing measures that cut biodiversity to very low levels. Yield increases with inputs such as fertilizers and removal of pathogens, predators, and competitors such as weeds. Costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units, such as making fields larger this means removing hedges , ditches and other areas of habitat. Pesticides kill insects, plants and fungi. Effective yields fall with on-farm losses, which may be caused by poor production practices during harvesting, handling, and storage.  201  The environmental effects of climate change show that research on pests and diseases that do not generally afflict areas is essential. In 2021, farmers discovered stem rust on wheat in the Champagne area of France, a disease that had previously only occurred in Morocco for 20 to 30 years. Because of climate change, insects that used to die off over the winter are now alive and multiplying.  202   203  Livestock issues Farmyard anaerobic digester converts waste plant material and manure from livestock into biogas fuel. A senior UN official, Henning Steinfeld, said that Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to todays most serious environmental problems.  204  Livestock production occupies 70 of all land used for agriculture, or 30 of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases , responsible for 18 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO 2 equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5 of the CO 2 . This comparison later turned out to be an apples-and-oranges analogy  205  . It produces 65 of human-related nitrous oxide which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO 2  and 37 of all human-induced methane which is 23 times as warming as CO 2 . It also generates 64 of the ammonia emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation  in the Amazon basin 70 of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feed crops.  206  Through deforestation and land degradation , livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity. A well documented phenomenon is woody plant encroachment , caused by overgrazing in rangelands.  207  Furthermore, the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP states that  methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns.  198  Land and water issues See also Environmental impact of irrigation Countries with the highest share of water withdrawal by agriculture in total withdrawal. Circular irrigated crop fields in Kansas . Healthy, growing crops of corn and sorghum are green sorghum may be slightly paler. Wheat is brilliant gold. Fields of brown have been recently harvested and plowed or have lain in fallow for the year. Land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most substantial way humans alter the Earths ecosystems, and is the driving force causing biodiversity loss . Estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50.  208  It is estimated that 24 of land globally experiences land degradation, a long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, with cropland being disproportionately affected.  209  Land management is the driving factor behind degradation 1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading land. Degradation can be through deforestation, desertification , soil erosion , mineral depletion, acidification , or salinization .  143  In 2021, the global agricultural land area was 4.79 billion hectares ha, down 2 percent, or 0.09 billion ha compared with 2000. Between 2000 and 2021, roughly two-thirds of agricultural land were used for permanent meadows and pastures 3.21 billion ha in 2021, which declined by 5 percent 0.17 billion ha. One-third of the total agricultural land was cropland 1.58 billion ha in 2021, which increased by 6 percent 0.09 billion ha.  107  Eutrophication , excessive nutrient enrichment in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia , leads to fish kills , loss of biodiversity , and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient mainly nitrogen and phosphorus  runoff and leaching from agricultural land. These nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater, with harmful effects on human populations.  210  Fertilizers also reduce terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light, favoring those species that are able to benefit from the added nutrients.  211  Agriculture simultaneously is facing growing freshwater demand and precipitation anomalies droughts, floods, and extreme rainfall and weather events on rainfed areas fields and grazing lands.  161  Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources,  212   213  and an estimated 41 percent of current global irrigation water use occurs at the expense of environmental flow requirements.  161  It is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern China, the Upper Ganges and the western US are being depleted, and new research extends these problems to aquifers in Iran, Mexico and Saudi Arabia.  214  Increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas, meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the worlds growing population with reduced water resources.  215  While industrial withdrawals have declined in the past few decades and municipal withdrawals have increased only marginally since 2010, agricultural withdrawals have continued to grow at an ever faster pace.  161  Agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems, including the destruction of natural wetlands, the spread of water-borne diseases, and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging, when irrigation is performed incorrectly.  216  Pesticides Main article Environmental impact of pesticides Spraying a crop with a pesticide Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5 million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant.  217  The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths.  218  Pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.  219  An alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature.  220   221  However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable,  222  and that pesticides can replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation.  219  The Pushpull agricultural pest management technique involves intercropping, using plant aromas to repel pests from crops push and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed pull.  223  Contribution to climate change Main article Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture World farm-gate greenhouse gas emissions by activity Agriculture contributes towards climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and by the conversion of non-agricultural land such as forests into agricultural land.  224  The agriculture, forestry and land use sector contribute between 13 and 21 of global greenhouse gas emissions.  225  Emissions of nitrous oxide , methane make up over half of total greenhouse gas emission from agriculture.  226  Animal husbandry is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.  227  Approximately 57 of global GHG emissions from the production of food are from the production of animal-based food while plant-based foods contribute 29 and the remaining 14 is for other utilizations.  228  Farmland management and land-use change represented major shares of total emissions 38 and 29, respectively, whereas rice and beef were the largest contributing plant- and animal-based commodities 12 and 25, respectively.  228  South and Southeast Asia and South America were the largest emitters of production-based GHGs.  228  Effects of climate change on agriculture Further information Effects of climate change on agriculture Climate change put significant part of crops in danger already at 1.5 degrees of warming. While in North America, Europe and central Asia the share of endangered crops is relatively little at this level of warming, in the Middle east and North Africa region for example, close to 50 of cropland is in danger. With further temperature rise the risk increase in all regions, in some more, in some less. Globally the cropland area in safe climatic zone decrease for all the major crop groups as warming exceed 1.5 degrees.  229   230  Sustainability Terraces, conservation tillage and conservation buffers reduce soil erosion and water pollution on this farm in Iowa. Main article Sustainable agriculture Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. There is not enough water to continue farming using current practices therefore how water, land, and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. A solution would be to give value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests.  231  Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.  232  Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable.  233  Technology permits innovations like conservation tillage , a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, reduces water pollution, and enhances carbon sequestration .  234  Agricultural automation can help address some of the challenges associated with climate change and thus facilitate adaptation efforts.  159  For example, the application of digital automation technologies e.g. in precision agriculture can improve resource-use efficiency in conditions which are increasingly constrained for agricultural producers.  159  Moreover, when applied to sensing and early warning, they can help address the uncertainty and unpredictability of weather conditions associated with accelerating climate change.  159  Other potential sustainable practices include conservation agriculture , agroforestry , improved grazing , avoided grassland conversion, and biochar .  235   236  Current mono-crop farming practices in the United States preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices, such as 23 crop rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops, unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon sequestration become policy.  237  The food demand of Earths projected population, with current climate change predictions, could be satisfied by improvement of agricultural methods, expansion of agricultural areas, and a sustainability-oriented consumer mindset.  238  Energy dependence Mechanized agriculture  from the first models in the 1940s, tools like a cotton picker could replace 50 farm workers, at the price of increased use of fossil fuel . Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources.  239  Between the 1960s and the 1980s, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly between 70 and 390 for wheat and 60 to 150 for rice, depending on geographic area  240  as world population doubled. Heavy reliance on petrochemicals has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output.  241  Industrialized agriculture depends on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways direct consumption on the farm and manufacture of inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery.  241  Indirect consumption includes the manufacture of fertilizers, pesticides, and farm machinery.  241  In particular, the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of agricultural energy usage.  242  Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2 of the nations energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has since gradually declined.  241  Food systems encompass not just agriculture but off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.  243   244  Plastic pollution Main articles Plastic pollution and plasticulture Plastic products are used extensively in agriculture, including to increase crop yields and improve the efficiency of water and agrichemical use. Agriplastic products include films to cover greenhouses and tunnels, mulch to cover soil e.g. to suppress weeds, conserve water , increase soil temperature and aid fertilizer application, shade cloth, pesticide containers, seedling trays, protective mesh and irrigation tubing. The polymers most commonly used in these products are low- density polyethylene LPDE, linear low-density polyethylene LLDPE, polypropylene PP and polyvinyl chloride PVC.  245  The total amount of plastics used in agriculture is difficult to quantify. A 2012 study reported that almost 6.5 million tonnes per year were consumed globally while a later study estimated that global demand in 2015 was between 7.3 million and 9 million tonnes. Widespread use of plastic mulch and lack of systematic collection and management have led to the generation of large amounts of mulch residue. Weathering and degradation eventually cause the mulch to fragment. These fragments and larger pieces of plastic accumulate in soil. Mulch residue has been measured at levels of 50 to 260 kg per hectare in topsoil in areas where mulch use dates back more than 10 years, which confirms that mulching is a major source of both microplastic and macroplastic soil contamination .  245  Agricultural plastics, especially plastic films, are not easy to recycle because of high contamination levels up to 4050 by weight contamination by pesticides, fertilizers, soil and debris, moist vegetation, silage juice water, and UV stabilizers and collection difficulties . Therefore, they are often buried or abandoned in fields and watercourses or burned. These disposal practices lead to soil degradation and can result in contamination of soils and leakage of microplastics into the marine environment as a result of precipitation run-off and tidal washing. In addition, additives in residual plastic film such as UV and thermal stabilizers may have deleterious effects on crop growth, soil structure, nutrient transport and salt levels. There is a risk that plastic mulch will deteriorate soil quality , deplete soil organic matter stocks, increase soil water repellence and emit greenhouse gases. Microplastics released through fragmentation of agricultural plastics can absorb and concentrate contaminants capable of being passed up the trophic chain.  245  Disciplines Agricultural economics Main article Agricultural economics In 19th century Britain, the protectionist Corn Laws led to high prices and widespread protest, such as this 1846 meeting of the Anti-Corn Law League .  246  Agricultural economics is economics as it relates to the production, distribution and consumption of agricultural goods and services.  247  Combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s, and grew significantly through the 20th century.  248  Although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent, major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history, ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the post- American Civil War Southern United States  249  to the European feudal system of manorialism .  250  In the United States, and elsewhere, food costs attributed to food processing , distribution, and agricultural marketing , sometimes referred to as the value chain , have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined. This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of value addition e.g. more highly processed products provided by the supply chain. Market concentration has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers farmers and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.  251  National government policies, such as taxation, subsidies , tariffs and others, can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products.  252  Since at least the 1960s, a combination of trade restrictions, exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world. In the 1980s, non-subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.  253  However, as of 2009 update , there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the most trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the oilseeds , sesame had the most taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have decreases more among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.  252  Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers.  254  Unprocessed commodities such as corn, soybeans, and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality, affecting the price the producer receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities, such as volume, number or weight.  255  Agricultural science Main article Agricultural science Further information Agronomy An agronomist mapping a plant genome Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. It covers topics such as agronomy, plant breeding and genetics, plant pathology , crop modeling, soil science, entomology , production techniques and improvement, study of pests and their management, and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation, waste management , and bioremediation .  256   257  The scientific study of agriculture began in the 18th century, when Johann Friedrich Mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum hydrated calcium sulphate  as a fertilizer.  258  Research became more systematic when in 1843, John Lawes and Henry Gilbert began a set of long-term agronomy field experiments at Rothamsted Research Station in England some of them, such as the Park Grass Experiment , are still running.  259   260  In America, the Hatch Act of 1887 provided funding for what it was the first to call agricultural science, driven by farmers interest in fertilizers.  261  In agricultural entomology, the USDA began to research biological control in 1881 it instituted its first large program in 1905, searching Europe and Japan for natural enemies of the spongy moth and brown-tail moth, establishing parasitoids such as solitary wasps and predators of both pests in the US.  262   263   264  Policy Main article Agricultural policy Direct subsidies for animal products and feed by OECD countries in 2012, in billions of US dollars  265  Product Subsidy Beef and veal 18.0 Milk 15.3 Pigs 7.3 Poultry 6.5 Soybeans 2.3 Eggs 1.5 Sheep 1.1 Agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters, economic stability including policies related to taxes, natural resources and environmental sustainability especially water policy , research and development, and market access for domestic commodities including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries.  266  Agricultural policy can also touch on food quality , ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the populations needs, and conservation . Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.  267  A 2021 report finds that globally, support to agricultural producers accounts for almost US540 billion a year.  268  This amounts to 15 percent of total agricultural production value, and is heavily biased towards measures that are leading to inefficiency, as well as are unequally distributed and harmful for the environment and human health.  268  There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness , trade lobbies and other groups. Agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions . Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.  269  The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAOs animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.  270  See also Main article Outline of agriculture Aeroponics Agricultural aircraft Agricultural engineering Agricultural finance Agricultural robot Agroecology Agrominerals Building-integrated agriculture Contract farming Corporate farming Crofting Ecoagriculture Farmworker Food loss and waste Food security Hill farming List of documentary films about agriculture Pharming genetics Remote sensing Rural Development Soil biodiversity Subsistence economy Sustainable agriculture Urban agriculture Vertical farming Vegetable farming References  a b c d Lowder, Sarah K.

    "content": "From Wikibooks, open books for an open world Fields in Poland Welcome to the Agriculture wikibook! Agriculture a term which encompasses farming and ranching is the process of producing food, feed, fiber, fuel, and other goods by the systematic raising of plants and animals. Agri is from Latin ager , meaning a field, and culture is from Latin cultura , meaning cultivation in the strict sense of tillage of the soil. Agriculture is defined with varying scopes, in its broadest sense using natural resources to produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services. A literal reading of the English word yields tillage of the soil of a field. In modern usage, the word agriculture covers all activities essential to foodfeedfiber production, including all techniques for raising and processing livestock. Agriculture is also short for the study of the practice of agriculturemore formally known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture is a major element of human history agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide social change, including the specialization of human activity when farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families, others in the tribe or nation or empire were freed to devote themselves to tasks other than food acquisition. About 42 of the worlds laborers are employed in agriculture, making it by far the most common occupation. Agriculture may often cause environmental problems because it changes natural environments and produces harmful byproducts. Some of the negative effects are Surplus of nitrogen and phosphorus in rivers and lakes Detrimental effects of herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and other biocides Conversion of natural ecosystems of all types into arable land Consolidation of diverse biomass into a few species Soil erosion Depletion of minerals in the soil Particulate matter, including ammonia and ammonium off-gassing from animal waste contributing to air pollution Release of feral plants and animals Odor from agricultural waste Soil salination Agriculture is cited as a significant adverse impact to biodiversity in many nations Biodiversity Action Plans, due to reduction of forests and other habitats when new lands are converted to farming. Some critics also include agriculture as a cause of current global climate change. According to the United Nations, the livestock sector primarily cattle, chickens, and pigs emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to our most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases - responsible for 18 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO 2 equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5 of the CO 2 . It produces 65 of human-related nitrous oxide which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO 2  and 37 of all human-induced methane which is 23 times as warming as CO 2 . Agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include Food safety Ensuring that the food supply is free of contamination Food security Ensuring that the food supply meets the populations needs Food quality Ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality Conservation Environmental impact Economic stability Chapters  edit  edit source  A printable version of Agriculture is available.  edit it  History of farming Farming mammals Farming game Farming plants Tillage Benefits Effects No-Tillingzero tillage Benefits Effects Industrial chemicals Pesticides Herbicides Soil conditioning Natural chemicals Manure Earthworms Microbes Organic farming Vegetables Perma culture Subsidies Policy Contributors  edit  edit source  httpwww.agclassroom.orggan httpwww.fao.orgagaglagllwrbimagesimage002.jpg Retrieved from  httpsen.wikibooks.orgwindex.php?titleAgricultureoldid4284133  Categories  BookAgriculture ShelfAgriculture and husbandry Hidden categories Books with print version SubjectAgriculture and husbandry SubjectAgriculture and husbandryall books SubjectMiscellaneousall books SubjectBooks by subjectall books BookWikibooks StacksBooks ShelfAgriculture and husbandryall books DepartmentMiscellaneousall books AlphabeticalA Partly developed books Books by completion statusall books",

    "title": "Wildfire disasters are increasingly in the news, yet less land is burning globally — here’s why",
    "content": "While wildfires are increasingly reported, the global area burned has declined by 26 over two decades, thanks to advancements in fire management and changes in land use. However, human exposure to wildfires has risen, especially in Africa, which accounts for the majority of global wildfire exposure. Intense fires are becoming more common in North and South America, driven by climate change and human activities. Worldwide, an estimated 440 million people were exposed to a wildfire encroaching on their home at some point between 2002 and 2021,new research shows. Thats roughly equivalent to the entire population of theEuropean Unionand the number has been steadily rising  up 40 per cent over those two decades. With intense, destructive fires often in the news, it can seem like more land is burning. And in parts of the world, including western North America, it is. Globally, however, our team of fire researchers also found that the total area burned actually declined by 26 per cent over those two decades. How is that possible? We found the driving reasons for those changes in Africa, which hasthe vast majority of all land burned, but the total burned area there has been falling. Agricultural activities in Africa are increasinglyfragmenting wildland areasthat are prone to burning. A cultivated farm field and roads can help stop a fires spread. But more farms and development in wildland areas also means more people can be exposed to wildfires. Drawing on our expertise inclimateandwildfiresciences andgeospatial modeling, we analyzed global wildfire activity over the past two decades. The results highlight some common misperceptions and show how the fire risk to humans is changing. Wildfire is a natural process that has existed for as long as vegetation has covered the Earth. Occasional fires in a forest are healthy. They clear out dead wood and leaf and branch litter, leaving less fuel for future fires to burn. That helps to keep wildfires from becoming too intense. However, intense fires can also pose serious threats to human lives, infrastructure and economies, particularly as more people move into fire-prone areas. North and South America have both experienced arise in intense wildfiresover the past two decades. Some notable examples include the2018 Camp Firein California and the2023 record-breaking Canadian wildfires, which generated widespread smoke that blanketed large parts of Canada and the eastern United States and even reached Europe. The increase in intense wildfires aligns with the intensification of fire weather around the world. Heat, low humidity and strong winds can make wildfires more likely to spread and harder to control. The number of days conducive to extreme fire behavior and new fire ignitions has increased bymore than 50 per cent over the past four decades globally, elevating the odds that the amount of land burned in a particular regionsets a new record. But fire weather is not the only influence on wildfire risk. The amount of dry vegetation and whether its in a continuous stretch or broken up, influences fire risk. So doignition sources, such as vehicles and power lines in wildland areas. Human activities can start fires and fuel climate change, which furtherdries out the land, amplifying wildfire activity.Fire suppression practicesthat dont allow low-intensity fires to burn can lead to the accumulation of flammable vegetation, raising the risk of intense fires. In recent years, a growing number of wildfire disasters in North America, Europe and Australia have captured global attention. From the deadly2025 Los Angeles firesto the devastating2019-2020 Australian bushfiresand the2018 wildfire in Athens, Greece, flames have increasingly encroached upon human settlements, claiming lives and livelihoods. However, wildfire exposure isnt limited to these high-profile regions  we simply hear more about them. The United States, Europe and Australia collectively account for less than 2.5 per cent of global human exposure to wildfire. Human exposure to fire occurs when peoples homes fall directly within the area burned by a wildfire. In stark contrast, Africa alone accounts for approximately85 per cent of all wildfire exposuresand 65 per cent of the global burned area. Remarkably, just five central African countries  the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola  experience half of all global human exposure to wildfires, even though they account for less than 3 per cent of the global population. These countries receive sufficient moisture to support plant growth, yet they are dry enough that trees and plants burn in frequent fires that in some places occur multiple times per year. We found that wildfire exposure increased across all continents except Europe and Oceania, but the underlying drivers of the increasevaried by region. In Africa,agricultural expansionhas led to more people living in fire-prone areas. In North America, particularly the United States,intensifying fire weather the hot, dry, windy conditions conducive to spreading fires  has led to increasinglyuncontrollable wildfires that threaten human settlements. In South America, a combination of rising drought frequency and severity, intensifying heat waves and agricultural expansion has amplified wildfire intensity and increased the population in fire-prone regions. In Asia, growing populations in fire-prone areas, combined with more days of fire-friendly weather, led to increased human exposure to wildfires. In contrast, Europe and Oceania have seen declining wildfire exposures, largely due to more people moving to cities and fewer living in rural, fire-prone zones. Communities can take steps to prevent destructive wildfires from spreading. For example, vegetation management, such as prescribed fires, can avoid fueling intense fires. Public education, policy enforcement and engineering solutions  such as vegetation reduction and clearance along roads and power lines can help reduce human-caused ignitions. As climate change intensifies fire weather and people continue to move into fire-prone zones, proactive mitigation will be increasingly critical.

    "title": "TenderCuts breaks even, first meat & seafood startup to post profits",
    "content": "TenderCuts becomes Indias first omnichannel meat and seafood retailer to achieve profitability, posting steady growth through restructuring and operational efficiency. Share with  MUMBAI, 10 September 2025 TenderCuts, Indias first omnichannel meat and seafood retailer, has announced that it has turned profitable, marking a first in the countrys organised fresh meat retail space. The milestone follows a year-long restructuring exercise focused on operational efficiency and cost management. In August 2025, the company reported a store-level EBIDTA of 10 per cent and an overall EBIDTA of 1 per cent on revenues of INR 5.6 crore. Revenue growth stood at 40 per cent year-on-year, signalling what the company described as a sustained turnaround. This profitability is the result of blending operational efficiency, offline trust, and tech-enabled convenience, said Sasikumar Kallanai, Co-founder and CEO of TenderCuts. It places us on a disciplined path to scale and redefine how India experiences fresh meat and seafood. The company attributed the turnaround to a cluster-first expansion strategy, streamlined sourcing and delivery practices, and sharp control over operating expenses. Unit-level profitability and customer loyalty formed the foundation of its strategy. Key operational highlights for August included Customer acquisition cost below INR 85, among the lowest in the industry. 88 per cent of traffic coming organically across website, app and retail outlets. 85 per cent monthly repeat purchase rate. 8 per cent month-on-month growth in new transacting users without heavy marketing spends. Profitability is a checkpoint, not the destination. It gives us the clarity to scale responsibly, added Kallanai. TenderCuts plans to deepen its presence in Chennai through complete market saturation before entering other South Indian cities. By March 2027, the company aims to expand its footprint to 50 outlets from the current 18, with a vision to become the countrys largest omnichannel meat and seafood brand.",
