# Project Commands for Farmer Guider AI

## 1. Setup and Installation
- Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
  source venv/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## 2. Running the Flask Application
- Start the Flask app (default port 5000):
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
- Access the app in browser at:
  ```
  http://localhost:5000/
  ```

## 3. Training the Crop Prediction Model
- Run the enhanced training script:
  ```bash
  python train_model.py
  ```
- This will:
  - Load existing datasets and generate synthetic data
  - Train multiple models and select the best one
  - Save the trained model as `model.pkl`
  - Save the enhanced dataset as `enhanced_farmer_data.csv`

## 4. Testing the Application
- Test chatbot integration by navigating to:
  ```
  http://localhost:5000/chat
  ```
- Test crop prediction form at:
  ```
  http://localhost:5000/predict
  ```
- Submit inputs manually or use auto-detection mode
- Verify prediction results and suggested blogs/videos on:
  ```
  http://localhost:5000/result
  ```

## 5. Additional Recommendations
- Regularly retrain the model with new data:
  ```bash
  python train_model.py
  ```
- Monitor model performance and update as needed
- Backup `model.pkl` and datasets regularly
- Use version control (Git) for source code management
- Consider deploying the app with a production server (e.g., Gunicorn, Nginx)
- Secure API keys and sensitive data using environment variables

## 6. Useful Commands
- Check Python version:
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
- List installed packages:
  ```bash
  pip list
  ```
- Run tests (if any test scripts are added):
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
